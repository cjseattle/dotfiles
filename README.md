# What are dotfiles?

Taking their name from the so-called hidden files or "dot files" on Linux/Mac that are preceded with a `.`, e.g. `.bash_profile`, "dotfiles" is a loose methodology for storing the things that are important to you about your computer's setup, with the goal of making it easy to get set up and running the way you are used to when/if you have to change/upgrade/replace your computer (or change jobs, or want to clone your work setup to your private machine, etc).

Many words and repositories have been written and created which will provide a better high-level intro than I can. Here are two:

[Getting started with dotfiles (Medium), Lars Kappert](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789)  

Everyone's dotfiles are different. I'm a luddite, so mine are pretty simple. For me, the dotfiles almost serve more as a reminder of what I like to use on my system, as they do for explicitly auto-configuring a new machine. But a little auto-setup can't hurt, right?

## Code Editor

Several of my steps assume you use Visual Studio Code as your IDE (integrated development environment), for example for your default Git editor and viewing your shell dotfiles (`.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`). If you don't use VS Code, you can search these dotfiles for occurrences of `code` or `VS Code` and customize accordingly. 

For VS Code, note that there is a [setting in the app itself](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) to sync your editor settings to the cloud; this is a great supplement to the dotfiles approach. 

Note that VS Code will be installed by the Homebrew bundlefile, described below (unless you modify the file to NOT install it, of course ðŸ˜‰).

## Document backup

Dotfiles are primarily concerned with settings and config files for your OS and applications. However, you most likely want to recreate your documents as well. Personally I use Dropbox to sync a handful of key folders, so I can re-create these easily on my new computer. Alternatively, if your old computer is still functioning, you can Airdrop (macOS) or otherwise share the files from your old computer to your new one. 

My dotfiles will attempt to install the Dropbox application on your new computer via Homebrew. If this happens to work, you will still need to sign into Dropbox on your new computer to be able to sync the files.

## Setting up your Mac

Presuming your new Mac is basically up to date and ready to go, start here. If you want to start from scratch (wipe your hard drive, etc), [consider these steps first](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles#a-fresh-macos-setup).

1. Install any available updates to macOS from the App Store
1. [Generate a new public and private SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) by running:

   ```zsh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjseattle/dotfiles/HEAD/ssh.sh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
   ```

1. Update your Github.com account and any Enterprise Github accounts [with your new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). 

1. **ZSH** zsh is now the default shell for Mac, if you want to make sure you have it installed, run `zsh --version`.  If you want to use [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), install it with the script below. Note that it will move any pre-existing `.zshrc` file to `~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`, so you can copy over any necessary configuration after installing. The install script for these dotfiles (described below) will wind up deleting the `.zshrc` that the default install creates, and symlinking `~/.zshrc` to the `.zshrc` file in the repo. This keeps the `.zshrc` in the repo as your source of truth -- as long as you push this to your own dotfiles repo, you'll be preserving all your hard work for the next time you need to install the dotfiles.

    ```zsh
    /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/HEAD/tools/install.sh)"
    ```
1. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with the script below. Note that installing it to your home folder is important in order to keep the symlinks it will create working.

    ```zsh
    git clone git@github.com:cjseattle/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```
> ðŸ’¡ You can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc#L2) file.


1. The installer script for these dotfiles is the [fresh.sh](./fresh.sh) script. It basically does this: 

    * Symlinks the `.zshrc` file in the repo to the `.zshrc` location in your home folder
    * Installs Homebrew stuff from the `Brewfile`
    * Clones the repos you work in from the `clone.sh` file
    * Symlinks your mackup config
    * Sources the macOS settings from the `.macos` file

    If you want to skip any of these steps, just comment them out in the file. You can always run them later individually.

1. Edit the [Brewfile](./Brewfile) to remove things you don't want installed, and add any that you do want installed. Do the same with the listing of Git repositories you want to clone in [clone.sh](./clone.sh), and aliases you like to use in [aliases.zsh](./aliases.zsh).

1. **Homebrew** Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the script below.

    ```zsh
    /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/HEAD/tools/install.sh)"
    ```

    After installation, issue the following which will set up your PATH correctly.
    ```zsh
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> $HOME/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    ```

1. Run the dotfiles installer script:

    ```zsh
    ~/.dotfiles/fresh.sh
    ```

1. **NVM** If you use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), install it with the script below. The installer will update your `.zshrc` so ZSH can find the binaries. Reminder you'll still need to install a version of Node.js with, e.g. `nvm install 14`, after nvm is installed.

    ```zsh
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```

1. Sign into Dropbox and sync files, alternatively sync from iCloud of whatever provider you use.
1. **Mackup** Once Dropbox has synced, assuming you have previously backed up with `mackup` on your old computer, restore preferences by running `mackup restore`.
1. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

## Your Own Dotfiles

**Please note that the instructions below assume you already have set up Oh My Zsh so make sure to first [install Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#getting-started) before you continue.**

If you want to start with your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.macos`](./.macos) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find many more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://caskroom.github.io/search) to check if the app you want to install is available.

Check out the [`aliases.zsh`](./aliases.zsh) file and add your own aliases. If you need to tweak your `$PATH` check out the [`path.zsh`](./path.zsh) file. These files get loaded in because the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` setting points to the `.dotfiles` directory. You can adjust the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) file to your liking to tweak your Oh My Zsh setup. More info about how to customize Oh My Zsh can be found [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization).

When installing these dotfiles for the first time you'll need to backup all of your settings with Mackup. Install Mackup and backup your settings with the commands below. Your settings will be synced to Dropbox so you can use them to sync between computers and reinstall them when reinstalling your Mac. If you want to save your settings to a different directory or different storage than Dropbox, [checkout the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#storage). Also make sure your `.zshrc` file is symlinked from your dotfiles repo to your home directory. 

```zsh
brew install mackup
mackup backup
```

You can tweak the shell theme, the Oh My Zsh settings and much more. Go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking.

Enjoy your own Dotfiles!

## Thanks

Hat tip to Eric Baer, wherever he is, for introducing me to the concept. This repo is forked from [Dries Vints's dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).
